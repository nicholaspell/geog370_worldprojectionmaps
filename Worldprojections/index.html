    <h1>In this project I learned how to display images in different projections</h1>
    
    <h2 style="color:red">To create these maps I installed and applied the Globe Builder QGIS plugin to set a world basemap and the Indicatrix mapper to demonstrate imperfections in these different displays in showcasing world shape and area. I then used the Coordinate Reference System to search for specific projections and apply them to my QGIS map.</p>
    
    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>This map focuses on preserving correct area which is shown by the equal distance between each and every circle. In doing this the map sacrifices shape which you can see in the outermost circles being more ovals than circles.</h3>

    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3>This map is azimuthal which means that direction from the center point is preserved. The shape and area are both not true in this projection as shown by the distances between the circles changing and the circles themselves stretching.</h3>

    <h2>WGS84 / Pseudo-Mercator Projection</h2>
    <h3>The Pseudo-Mercator Projection focuses entirely on preserving shape as shown by the circles holding their circular shape throughout the projection. In doing this the map sacrifices other factors most significantly area as most prominantly demonstrated by Greenland being almost the same size as Africa which is not proportionally accurate.</h3>

    <h2>Sphere Winkel I</h2>
    <h3>Sphere Winkel I is most similar thusfar to the azimuthal map that preserves direction above all esle. Except this map gives more credit to area and distance than the Aitoff projection did.</h3>

<h2>World Cylindrical Equal Area</h2>
<h3>The World Cylindrical Equal Area map focuses above all else on preserving the area of the world which leaves the map with large distortions in shape as shown by the lack of visibility of Antarctica and Greenland.</h3>

<h2>World Equidistant Conic</h2>
<h3>This conic projection gives a good sense of distance while largely sacrificing area as demonstrated in the vast inequality in sizing of the squares from the inside of the projection outwards.</h3>

<h2>North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant</h2>
<h3>This projection works similarly to that of the World Equidistant Conic except this map also prioritizes maintaining direction from center.</h3>

<h2>World Craster Parabolic</h2>
<h3>The craster projection maintains area throughout the projection. This map sacrifices shape as seen towards the edges of the map along with distance and directions.</h3>

<h2>World Eckert III</h2>
<h3>This projection seems to lose sense of all facets of these projections the map progresses outwards. Inwards the shape, distance, and area are well kept </h3>

    <h2 style="color:red">Now, you should <u>add the following projections on your own:</u></h2>
    <h3>EPSG: 3857, 53018, 54034, 54027, 102016, and two additional projections that you choose.</h3>
